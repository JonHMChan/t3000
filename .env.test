# These are environment variables used for the CI/CD pipeline

# Since the ".env" file is gitignored, you can use the ".env.example" file to
# build a new ".env" file when you clone the repo. Keep this file up-to-date
# when you add new variables to `.env`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any
# secrets in it. If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named
# ".env" and populate it with your secrets.

# When adding additional environment variables, the schema in "/env/schema.mjs"
# should be updated accordingly.

# For local development and testing, SENTRY_ENABLED should be "false"

# Because `pnpm build` fires `next build` for test env, NODE_ENV is always production
# so SENTRY_ENABLED must be used and SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN is required in test
